# Menu Script â€” Bash Automation Tool

This is a simple yet powerful menu-driven Bash script to automate common Linux system tasks like viewing system info, monitoring processes, checking disk usage, and cleaning temporary files.
This is a Stage 1 portfolio project focused on clean scripting, error handling, and structured code.

## Features

- System information â€” date, hostname, user, uptime

- Monitor multiple processes â€” check if theyâ€™re running or not

- Disk usage report â€” check the size of any directory

- Cleanup .tmp files â€” delete temporary files while preserving important ones

- Exit easily with q, Q, or 5

- Proper error handling for empty inputs and invalid paths

- Built-in --help flag for usage instructions

## Usage
./menu_script.sh


Optional:

./menu_script.sh --help


Menu Options

1) Show system info
2) Monitor processes
3) Disk usage report
4) Cleanup temp files
5) Exit

Example run:

```
********************************
1) Show system info
2) Monitor processes
3) Disk usage report
4) Cleanup temp files
5) Exit
********************************

Enter any number between 1 to 5 based on above options: 1
############## SYSTEM INFORMATION ##############
Date: Thu Oct 17 18:20:32 IST 2025
Hostname: dhamo-VirtualBox
User: root
Uptime: up 1 hour, 25 minutes
âœ… Task completed. Returning to menu...
```

## Struggles Faced

Initially, I tried to implement the cleanup logic using a for loop to list all files and manually filter out .tmp files.
This worked â€” but it was unnecessarily long and messy.

After experimenting, I discovered the find command.
Even there, I faced another small hurdle: find prints full file paths, which isnâ€™t user-friendly.
Finally, I learned how to filter only the filename using -printf "%f\n".

## Learnings

For every requirement, I tried to build the logic on my own first.
Then I searched for better or cleaner ways to achieve the same thing.
It would be a lie if I said I came up with every logic myself ðŸ˜‚ â€” but this approach helped me understand why each syntax works, not just copy it.

## Small Intro About Me

This is my first script that can actually solve common real-world problems.
I learned a lot of Bash syntax, shortcuts, and professional scripting techniques just through this project.

Even though I have 3 years of experience working with Redfish at the application layer in embedded systems, Iâ€™ve always been curious about whatâ€™s happening under the hood in Linux.

This project is the first step in that journey.

Short-term goal: Build more advanced Bash scripts and master Linux automation.

Long-term goal: Solve bigger problems and deploy large-scale Linux projects.

This is more than just a beginner script for me â€” itâ€™s the foundation of my freelancing journey in Linux automation.
